    "ELECTRIC_CHARGES_AND_FIELDS.pdf": "Summary of the PDF selected: Electric charges, fundamental to the universe, exhibit polarity where like charges repel and unlike charges attract, and are gained or lost by objects, with all matter containing electric charges. The electric force is pervasive, and substances are classified as conductors, insulators, or semiconductors based on their resistance to electric current. Electric charge is quantized, existing in discrete units, and Coulomb's Law quantifies the electrostatic force between point charges, varying inversely with the square of the distance and directly proportional to the product of the charges. The principle of superposition allows for calculating the total electrostatic force by summing individual forces, and the electric field describes these interactions, varying in strength and direction with location, as visualized by field lines; denser lines indicate stronger fields. Gauss's Law relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the total enclosed charge, simplifying calculations, especially for symmetrical charge distributions. Charged objects interact with electric fields through charge distribution, which can be discontinuous at a microscopic level and continuous at a macroscopic level using charge density, line charge density, and surface charge density, and when a charged object polarizes a dielectric material, it induces a net dipole moment. Electric fields around specific geometries, such as an infinitely long wire (radial outward and constant) and an infinite plane sheet (parallel to the x-direction), can be calculated using formulas derived from Coulomb's law and superposition. An electric dipole experiences torque in an external electric field but no net force, with its field strength varying depending on its orientation relative to the field. The unit of charge (Coulomb) is defined based on current, and the constant 'k' has an approximate value of 9 \u00d7 109 N m2 C\u20132.
